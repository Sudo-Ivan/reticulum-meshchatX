1. for messages fix:

convo goes off edge, near edge should be ... 3 dots

long names push the last message/announced seconds/time to right and nearly off the side, fix please

2. interfaces:

3 dots background circle is a oval, fix to be circle

on 3 dots clicked there is still white background the buttons have dark backgrounds though but main dropdown window is white fix depdning on theme

also on 3 dots drop down it still makes me scroll down in that interfaces window, we can expand that interfaces box os something so this crap doesnt hapen or if dropdown is above it

rework propagation nodes page with new UI/UX please like rest of app.

1. the attachment dropups/popups are white on dark mode, they need a ui/ux rework.

2. for settings add ability to set inbound stamp, ref lxmf via python -c if needed.

3. add multi-identity / account suport and a switcher at bottom with ability to create, delete or import/export identies from other apps. 

for all this you will likely need to look at my ren chat app for stamps, multi-identity, /mnt/projects/ren-messenger/

its pretty simple.
